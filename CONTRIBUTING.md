## Contributing code

This plugin is written in TypeScript. It tries to adhere to the [requirements for a Homebridge Verified Plugin](https://github.com/homebridge/verified#requirements).

Since it's a plugin for Homebridge, their [developer documentation](https://developers.homebridge.io/) tends to be a good reference to figure out how services and characteristics relate to each other and which predefined services and characteristics exist.

Unfortunately, at this point in time, there is no documentation on how this plugin is structured internally (other than the code itself). If you have specific questions, feel free to ask them via the GitHub issue section or on the `z2m` channel on the Homebridge Discord server.

### Pull Requests

Some automation is put in place to perform some automated checks on a pull request. If you change code, please try to add automated tests to verify the behavior (see the `test` folder).
